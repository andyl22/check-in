#Check In App
Something I wanted to create for myself and give incentive to use as motivation for consistent studying across multiple different apps.

#User system
Allows users to add daily repeatable tasks that you want to check in everyday
Allows users to specify time length for a task and fill in the completed time on the check in process
Allows users to check their tasks off
Allows users to add notes to their daily check ins
Count the streak for daily check ins (or implement something similar to the github calendar)
Everytime you check everything off, you accumulate a daily streak
